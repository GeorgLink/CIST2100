## Key Activities

Our key activities are shipping laptops for students to use. We'll be developing physical and digital products. In terms of physical products we'll be providing our store front for students to help them make any choices on renting laptops. In terms of digital products our app will be looking to provide something to the similar effect of a store, but on a users phone.
