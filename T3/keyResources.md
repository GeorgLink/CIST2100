## Key Activities

Our key activities are shipping laptops for students to use. We'll be developing physical and digital products. In terms of physical products we'll be providing our store front for students to help them make any choices on renting laptops. In terms of digital products our app will be looking to provide something to the similar effect of a store, but on a users phone. Problems will be solved through digital and physical means whether they have a question to ask on the app/website or in the store we'll be able to help. 

## Key Resources

* Secure room to store laptops
* Rented servers
* Application developers
* Physical office location
* Store front (at office)
* Reliable shipping service
* Laptops
* Our brand name "Laptops for Students
* IT services and clerks for store front

## Key Technologies
Our business focuses on three key areas in relation to requiring key technologies:
* The online storefront
* The mobile application
* The logistics management

The website/digital storefront requires servers hosting a web service stack such as a LAMP stack. These servers will need an OS, web server software, and a database.
The mobile application will require back-end APIs to display dynamic content and products, as well as process payments, so a web application stack is required here. Our mobile developers will also need access to a decent IDE and test environments to develop new updaates to the mobile app.
Our logistics service will largely be managed using a transaction processing system such as an inventory management system. This system should allow efficient tracking and maintenance of inventory, deliveries, and allow access for support to assist with customer problems.
