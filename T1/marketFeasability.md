Authors: Kyle, Louis, Son

Team Leader: Son Nguyen

## Customer Segment ideas:
Probably targeting students (or those in need of a specific software TBD) in the Omaha Metro area.

Since it has to be an online business we'll have a website to order laptops with choices for software on.
Probably should use notebooks/chromenbooks for ease of shipping and reducing cost, as long as they're fast enough to do what is required for their work.

## Value proposition ideas:
Easily obtainable software and hardware quickly and efficiently. For profit retail business.
