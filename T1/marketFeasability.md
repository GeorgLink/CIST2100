CIST 2100 - Orgs Apps and Technology
Authors: Kyle, Louis, Son

## Customer Segment ideas:
Probably targeting students (or those in need of a specific software TBD) in the Omaha Metro area.

Since it has to be an online business we'll have a website to order laptops with choices for software on.
Probably should use notebooks/chromenbooks for ease of shipping and reducing cost, as long as they're fast enough to do what is required for their work.

## Value proposition ideas:
The value from our business will come from the quick and easy online retail application we will build for renting laptops.
Value will also come from the fact that students will be able to work wherever and whenever, without ever having to go to a library to use their systems. 
Our app will first be available for mobile devices due to the fact that students who need laptops will likely only have a phone to use. 
The application will show the types of laptops available, their specifications, and pricing rates for each day the student would like to rent them.
After the student chooses from the list of laptops they will be able to pay in the app for the number of days desired and choose to either have it shipped to their address or pick it up at our office location. 
This simple application will solve the pain points that students without laptops often face when they cannot fit going to the library in their schedule.
Our business will provide students with the freedom of working on whatever they want to, wherever they want to, whenever they want to.
