## Establishing Communication

Since our company is looking to market toward a younger crowd we will use social media as a primary source for customer reach out. We'll primarily use Instagram and Twitter to attempt to reach out to college aged students. Another method for reaching out is via handing out information on campus. Handing out fliers will be a great way to get the initial word out as we'll be directly contacting the crowd we want to help. Our final way of getting to students is by pitching our business to faculty members in hopes that they will let students know about our service and what we do.

Customers will evaluate our products through our online store where they will see the laptops we provide along with the laptops specifications and the daily rental price. While purchasing from the website or app the customer will be able to choose their pick-up method. They may either have it shipped to their address or may pick it up from one of our locations. After this, the customer will see updates on the progress of getting their laptop ready to use and will be alerted when the laptop has either arrived or is ready for pick up. Extra support is provided on the app or website via a listing of our email, phone number, and address for customers to ask any burning questions they may have. We will also offer a chat option on the website where people will be able to support those with questions.

## Maintaining Communication

Our laptop business would maintain relationships with customers through public communication channels as social media, and private communication channels such as opt-in email and text messaging.

Public communication would consist of offers related to updates to the service such as new hardware and software offerings, while private communication channels would tailor offerings and discounts to a user based off of their purchases.

The relationship we'd expect from our customers is largely a mix of Self-service and Automated services when pruchasing and selected products, with some Personal assistance support available for helping with incomplete orders or hardware/software issues.

As a rental business our relationship with the customer largely depends on the user's need for a specific product, so there is limited opporotunities to up-sell any other products, but a lot of opporotunities to maintain a customer through private discounts and offers.
